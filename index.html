          Welcome to the Coding Quiz Challenge. This is a timed quiz. When you
          click the start button, you will be presented with a series of 10
          questions, and you will be given 60 seconds to answer all of them, as 
          indicated by the timer in the top right. If you answer a
          question correctly, no time will be deducted from the timer. If you
          answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from the
          timer. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the
          quiz is over and your score will be displayed. You will be given the
          option to save your initials and your score once the quiz is over.
        </p>
