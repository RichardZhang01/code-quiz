# Code Quiz
> By Richard Zhang

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to encorporate all of the things I learned about JavaScript to create a dynamic page that responds to user inputs.
- I built this project to better understand how functions interact with each other and the HTML document, the logic of creating a quiz, and how a page becomes dynamic with the incorporation of JavaScript code. 
- This webpage can be used to practice an actual quiz that is timed. The quiz questions can be updated to change what the user is tested on. It's also a demonstration of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to create something dynamic.
- I learned a lot of things about JavaScript in particular through the creation of this project. I learned a couple new functions and how even built-in methods can be altered to perform a more specific task (such as the sort function to sort an array of objects). I learned how the hidden property can be used to show the user specific sections under certain conditions. I also expanded on my ability to use logic when creating something to perform a specific task.
-  This project incorporates a lot of custom functions that work together to create something cohesive enough to be called a quiz. I still think I have a long way to go, but I am satisfied with my creation. I think it's a good attempt at solving this challenge for an individual that is new to coding in general.
- **I should note that all of the questions and answers were taken from third-party sites. I did not come up with them on my own. Although this project was meant to learn about JS, CSS, and HTML, and not about the questions themselves, I wanted to make a point of noting this. Sites used include: [Quizizz](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5c6d209c55dba0001c8b2aec/html-css-and-js), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_quiz.asp), and [StackHowTo](https://stackhowto.com/html-css-mcqs-multiple-choice-questions-and-answers-part-2/).**
